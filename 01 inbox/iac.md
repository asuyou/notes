**Infrastructure As Code**

A provisioning architecture where deployment can be handled by scripted automation and [[workflow orchestration]]

If the script is secure, then the infrastructure will be secure and we will have consistent builds

This ideology is similar to what [[nixos]] system have

## Snowflake systems

This is where a system requires a different config from other templates

## Idempotence

This is part of IaC where actions always create the same result regardless of previous state (something similar to [[functional programming]]?)
