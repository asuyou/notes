Cloud computing relies on virtualization significantly

## Cloud types

There are 4 main cloud types

### Public

Service providers makes resources available over the internet

### Private

A firm creates its own cloud that it can access as an internal enterprise service

This is when security is more important that cost as all infrastructure has be maintained

### Hybrid

Combination of the above 2 where some are provided by each

### Community

Resources and costs are shared between many different organization who all need the common need for that service

## Hyper convergence

This allows providers to integrate the storage, networks, servers without hardware changes

## VDI

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure

Essentially a full desktop but on the web but can  be destroyed and reset easily

To keep these safe we need [[secure volumes]] and [[secure enclaves]]
