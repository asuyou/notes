This is a cryptographic function taking in an input and providing a unique output. They are always the same length

- MD5: 128-bit hash file
- SHA-1: 160-bit
- SHA-2: Inludes 224, 256, 348, 512
- SHA-3: 224 - 512
- HMAC
- RIPEMD
- LANMAN: Based on [[DES]] for old windows passwords
- NTLM Hash: Uses [[RC#4]]
- NTLMv2 using HMAC-MD5
