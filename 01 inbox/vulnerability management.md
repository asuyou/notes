It is the practice of finding and mitigating vulnerabilities in a cycle of scanning and patching.

1. What is the value of the information if it got compromised?
2. What is the threat?
3. What mitigation strategies can we apply?

This will allow you to **scope** and focus the assessments so they make an impact.

1. Define the desired state of security
2. Create a baseline
3. Prioritize the vulnerabilities that matter the most
4. Mitigate vulnerabilities
5. Monitor the network and systems

Testing a network might occur when we use either an automated tool or use a [[pen test]]
The difference is that a vulnerability assessment provides an inside look whilst a pen test shows it from an attackers POV

## Network mapping

Discovery and documentation of connectivity in a network like solar winds or zen map

## Vulnerability scan

Identify threats on the network

## Network sniffing

Finding and investigating other computers on the network by analyzing the network traffic

This includes tools like wireshark
