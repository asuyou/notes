If a cloud server crashes due to 1 organization then many other ones are also affected and this applies to data security as well

To keep servers from going down, they need to be setup with proper failover and redundancy to keep loads balanced across multiple server

Data that is left behind needs to be looked after. When you deprovision a resource, remnants of that data might be left behind so the next person to provision that space might be able to bring it back and use it
