```ad-quote
   o  The Mobile Network Gateway (MNG): The MNG is the [[mn]]'s default
      router, which provides IP address management.  The MNG performs
      functions such as offering Quality of Service (QoS), applying
      subscriber-specific policy, and enabling billing and accounting;
      these functions are sometimes collectively referred to as
      "subscriber-management" operations.  The mobile network
      architecture, as shown in [[ipv6 phone networks]], defines the necessary protocol
      interfaces to enable subscriber-management operations.  The MNG is
      typically located in the Home Network.
