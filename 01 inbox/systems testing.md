## Black-box testing

Occurs then a tester is not given any information before testing

You are blind to start with

## White-box testing

Opposite of [[#Black-box testing]]

Inner workings are provided like diagrams, credentials and sometime source code

## Gray-box testing

Some data is given to the tester but not everything

```ad-example
User level credentials are given to the tester but not admin ones and it us up to them to find out how to become an admin
```

You are often trying to find obscure error conditions
