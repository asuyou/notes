# Some notes

Welcome to a repo of my notes made using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) using a zettlekasten method to take them

This is really new to me so things will change over time

Most of these are quite empty as they are some of the basic ones that I have made for the compTIA security+. There are some more comprehensive ones but significantly less...

I will expand them when I do more reading around the topic and remember to make notes
