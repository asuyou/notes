This is different from [[xss basics]]

This is when an attacker forces a user to execute actions on a web server that they are already authenticated

```ad-example
A user clicks on a link that loads a script that sends a request to a bank to remove funds from their account

Below is a normal request
`GETÂ http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=BOB&amount=100`

The attacker gets the victim to click on a link like the one below
`GET http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA&amount=100000`

As the user is already authenticated, the bank sees it as a real request and makes the transfer
```
