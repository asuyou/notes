There are multiple types of fuzzing depending on the scenario but generally  it is

Injection of random data into software in an attempt to find failures, hidden features, memory leaks and the like

```ad-example
Apending strings from a predefined list to the end of a URL and analyzing the response to see if you can find secret areas like `/admin` or other areas that should not be accessed
```
