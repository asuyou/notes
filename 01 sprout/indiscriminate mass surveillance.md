Personal issues arise from mass data collection and this is clear from the [[snowden leaks]] where due to [[TEMPORA]].

We should take a different moral approach from surveillance on a few individuals to entire groups of people

Arguments about privacy focus on not interfering so no amount of data collection matters as long as it is not acted upon. People doubt that governments can be reasonable when it comes to this however.

Neo-republican opinion differs as it doesn't matter if the information is acted upon, just if it is possible.

We should use a discursive, communicative form or rationality rather than the current ones used by governments where actions are take to an end. This is based on people being able to not only communicate without intervention but also determine the structure and rules themselves.

The only source of a true democracy

This paper does not address societies where democracy is not what the governments strive for. E.g. China, Russia, the US etc
