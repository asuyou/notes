We a redundant power supply to ensure we have constant power and do not have a single point of failure. This is seen on servers commonly

Surge: An unexpected increase in voltage
Spike: A short transient increase in voltage

Sag: Unexpected decrease in voltage

Brownout: When voltage drops to the point it causes things like lights to dim
Blackout: Total loss of power for a prolonged period of time

To prevent all of this wee need Uninterruptible Power Supply. Combines a surge protector and backup battery but don't large too long

## Backup generator

These need to be used if prolonged loss of power is an issue (it is)

### Gas powered

Least expensive but very loud and need to be started manually

### Permanently installed

These are larger, usually run on diesel and can power the building

### Battery Inverter generator

Very quite and are based on lead acid batteries but require changing batteries every so often
