**3rd Generation Partnership Program**

A [[mn]] accesses the network by connecting to an [[apn]] that maps to a mobile gateway

The [[mn]] needs an end-to-end link to the gateway

```ad-quote
In the Long-Term Evolution (LTE)
networks, this link is realized through an Evolved Packet System
(EPS) bearer.  In the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) networks, such a link is realized through a Packet Data
Protocol (PDP) context.
