```ad-quote
   o  Access Network Gateway (ANG): The ANG forwards IP packets to and
      from the [[mn]].  Typically, this is not the MN's default router, and
      the ANG does not perform IP address allocation and management for
      the mobile nodes.  The ANG is located either in the Home Network
      or in the Visited Network.
