This is how we backup data and is different from [[data redundancy]]

We also see [[tape rotation]]

## Full

All of the contents but take a lot of time and data

## Incremental

Only backups the data that has changed from the previous backup

## Differential backup

Only backups data changed since last **full** backup

## Snapshot

Used mostly in cloud to capture entire OS system image including data and apps
