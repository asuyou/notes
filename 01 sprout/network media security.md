This refers to the copper, fiber optic and coax able used in the network

To prevent this we need a [[PDS system]]

## EMI

**Electromagnetic interference**

Disturbance from electrical circuit due to radiation and EM conduction and is caused by all electronics

We should install shielding or use (STP) cables

## RFI

**Radio Frequency Interfeance**

Same as EMI but is radio instead and causes problems for things like wireless devices. This can be caused by things like mobile towers etc.

## Crosstalk

When a signal on one copper wire causes an undesired effect on another one. This is not common on newer networks.

Networks should use a `1:10` block

## Data Emanation

EM field generated by a network cable during transmission. This can be caught and rebuilt up. Use fiber optic cables to prevent
