Cognition refers to information in the mind and generally encompasses thoughts, beliefs and memories.

This can be further split into conscious and unconscious thoughts which can both affect behavior.

Unlike [[Learning]], we cannot measure this but it is instead inferred from what we observe.

People look at the behaviors that underlie. They look at conscious and unconscious beliefs that affect our beliefs.

To a cognitive psychologist, experience in an environment leads to change in knowledge or beliefs, and that leads to changes in behavior.

Jealousy, in this case would be seen as ones interactions with another and perceived vulnerability in a relationship.
