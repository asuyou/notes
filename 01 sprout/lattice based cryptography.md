This is essential for the future of [[encryption]] and [[cryptography]] due to the issues caused by quantum computers  and how most conventional algorithms can be cracked by [[shors algorithm]] and [[govers search]]

A lattice is just an evenly space grid of points which can be in $n$ dimensions $\mathcal{L}$
