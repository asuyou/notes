This represents a set of which has 2 operations (+ and \*) . Generally the set is additive and multiplicative.

```ad-note
A ring is a set with operators $+$ and $\cdot$ and follows the properties below:
1. It is an [[abelian group]]
2. It acts under closed multiplication
  $$\forall a,b \in R \qquad a \cdot b \in R$$
  $$ \forall a,b,c \in R \qquad a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$$
3. Multiplication distributes over addition
```

$\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integers and is fairly basic

Used in [[lattice based cryptography]]
