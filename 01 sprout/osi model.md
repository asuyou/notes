**Open Systems Interconnection**

Used to explain network communication between a host and remote device over a LAN or WAN

1. Physical: This is the data cables like cat6
2. Data Link: Switching, MAC addresses
3. Network layer: IP addresses, routing
4. Transport: TCP/UDP
5. Session: Session management
6. Presentation: JPEG, MOV
7. Application: HTTP, SMTP

When we receive data we move down from layer 1 to layer 7 and if we were troubleshooting we should move down like this

And then when we send data we move the other way back up
