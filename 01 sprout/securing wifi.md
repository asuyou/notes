Same as things as in [[securing network]] with strong passwords etc

## SSID

**Service Set Identifier**

Unique identifies the network as is basically the name of the WAP

In the real world disabling this doesn't matter much but in the exam just say to disable it

## Rogue Access Points

Unauthorized WAP that allows access to the secure network

## Evil Twin

A rogue WAP with the same SSID
