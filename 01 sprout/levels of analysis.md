Peoples behavior can be determined by different levels of thinking

- [[neural]]: the brain
- [[Physiological]]: Internal chemical functions like hormones
- [[Genetics]]: Through genes
- [[Evolutionary]]: Via natural selection

The ones below are more due to the environment rather than via evolution. These follow more of a *nurture* argument rather than *nature*.

- [[Learning]]: Prior experience in a similar environment
- [[Cognitive]]: Knowledge or beliefs as a cause (surely this includes thinking)
- [[Social]]: Influence of other people like peer pressure
- [[Cultural]]: Beliefs from the persons culture
- [[Developmental]]: Age related

> Surely some of these are quite similar with slight variations...
> Yes according to the book, even the most distant ones are complementary
	
```ad-example
The textbook applies the concept to *sexual jealousy*. This being emotions & behaviours resulting from a potential or real partner interacts with another person.
