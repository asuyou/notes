It is the practice of using math and solving codes to hide the real meaning of information

We generally see this in the form of [[encryption]] which is just converting normal information into chiphertext which cannot be read

This is a very very vast topic that includes things from [[lattice based cryptography]] to [[ECC]] and much more but is generally seen in security. This is not to be confused with obfuscating data but it still being publically readable
