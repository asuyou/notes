A computer system that is designed to perform a specific function

These are static environments where frequent changes don't happen and therefore security is generally an afterthought

## PLC

**Programmable Logic Controller**

A type of computer designed to automate and monitor mechanical system and is generally seen in industry

## SoC

**System-on-Chip**

A processor that integrates multiple platforms functionality onto a single chip that is generally more power efficient

## RTOS

**Real time OS**

Prioritizes deterministic execution of operations to ensure consistent response

These have tolerances in the micro-seconds

## FPGA

**Field Programmable Gate Array**

A processor that can be programmed to perform a specific function by the customer rather than the manufacture
