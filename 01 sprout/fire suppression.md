## Wet pipe sprinklers

Water is already filled and are just waiting for the bulb to melt or break to release the water

## Dry pip sprinklers

Filled pressurized air that is ready to pump water when needed

## Pre-action system

Will activate when heat or smoke is detected

## In server rooms

We need a clean agent system that pushes CO2 into the server room that suffocates the fire
