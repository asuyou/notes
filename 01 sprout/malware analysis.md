## Static analysis

This is when we analyze malware or other programs without running the program. We can generally see things like strings and other common tags. Further, we are able to reverse engineer and figure out how the malware spreads or maintains persistence which allows us to prevent further attacks.

May use tools like radare2 or Ghidra

On windows specifically, we have `capa` and `detect it easy`

## Dynamic analysis

This need to be performed in a sandbox. We essentially run the malware and analyze it based on what it does to the system. We can use tools like [procmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to see things like files created or [[registry keys]] modified and network connections.
