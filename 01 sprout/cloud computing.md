Cloud computing relies on virtualization significantly and you can see it being used in fields from web technologies to using something like google colab for running AI using shared GPUs

The drawback however is that it can become costly, data is not always secure and if a vendor locks you in, then it becomes much more difficult to move

## Cloud types

There are 4 main cloud types

### Public

Service providers makes resources available over the internet

### Private

A firm creates its own cloud that it can access as an internal enterprise service

This is when security is more important that cost as all infrastructure has be maintained

### Hybrid

Combination of the above 2 where some are provided by each

### Community

Resources and costs are shared between many different organization who all need the common need for that service

## Hyper convergence

This allows providers to integrate the storage, networks, servers without hardware changes

## VDI

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure

Essentially a full desktop but on the web but can  be destroyed and reset easily

To keep these safe we need [[secure volumes]] and [[secure enclaves]]
