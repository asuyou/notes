This is very old is rare to see in modern development
```

Each phase is broken down into different aspects and as one is completed, the net on is tarted

It generally consists of 

1. **Project planning**: High level planning is conducted
2. **Requirements**
3. **Analysis**
4. **Design**: We focus on overarching inputs and outputs of functions
5. **Coding**: Basic testing is conducted as well
6. **Testing**
7. **Deployment**
8. **Maintenance**: This includes [[version control]] that is mainly major, minor, and build number scheme to determine which software is used

This makes it very difficult to account for changes
