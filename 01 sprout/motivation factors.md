There are multiple factors that makes it easier for users to become victims to these kinds of attacks

## Authority

If a request comes from someone of power, you are more likely to carry out the actions. It is also the factor between things like [[phishing]] emails where someone is lying and using the authority of a company

## Urgency

This should be self evident.

```ad-example
If someone calls you saying that you need to make a payment in the next 10 minutes or your house will be siezed, you are more likely to do it despity any kind of training.
```

This leverages that fact that you are likely to be more panicked near the start and therefore make more irrational decisions; the longer you wait, the more you calm down and regain rationality.

## Social proof

People are more likely to enter a site if we see others have had positive experiences on it. However, these can be fake.

## Scarcity

This is also self evident

## Likeability

If you like someone more, you are more likely to trust them

## Fear

This can be found in [[#Urgency]] but also in other things like malware etc.
