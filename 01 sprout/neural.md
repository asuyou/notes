Everything is a product of the nervous system. This routes tries to explain experiences based on the nervous system.

This falls under that category of [[behavioral neuroscience]].

Some of the science involved is studied at a macro and micro scale.

```ad-example
At the micro level, they might analyze certain neurons or small groups and see how they contribute to processes.

At the macro level, they might try to map out the brain as a whole with certain sections responsible for different things like grammatical knowledge. This is where terms like the hypocampus comes from.
```

If look back at the example of jealousy from [[levels of analysis]], we see that jealousy correlates with higher activation rates in the left frontal cortex as found by an EEG.

```ad-seealso
Frontal left cortex os associated with [[approach-motivation]] like pleasurable activites.

On the other hand, the right frontal cortex is associated with [[withdrawl-motivation]] and avoiding negative stimuli.
```

The researchers believed that jealousy was aimed at preventing a liaison between the person and the target and re-establishing a relationship.
