Written by an FBI terrorist negotiator that takes us through interesting concepts, like how in negotiation, the heart will beat out any and all logic and math.

He recalls different stories about how he applied his knowledge much further than terrorist incidents; using it in business negotiation is just as powerful. After all, how different is a burglar and a CEO. 

**Psychology is critical.**

If you can affect the other persons irrational side, its effect is much further reaching than just applying yourself to their logical self.

[[Calibrated Questions]] is one of the many concepts applied and reinforces just how powerful it is to approach a negotiation looking at the human aspect rather than getting locked down into the technical details.

Many, many, many situations are led by the animalistic brain. In negotiation with a kidnapper, where goals are not clear and in a very intensive scenario, the emotional side is the key. The FBI were forced to apply this strategy after many losses.

In the field [[emotional and psychological tactics]] had to be developed.
